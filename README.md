## 🚀 Quick Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- CUDA compatible GPU (optional, but recommended for faster training)

### Installation

1. **Clone or download the project files**
   ```bash
   # Create project directory
   mkdir flappy-bird-rl
   cd flappy-bird-rl
   
   # Copy the provided Python files here:
   # - flappy_bird_game.py
   # - flappy_bird_rl_agent.py
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment (recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv flappy_rl_env
   
   # Activate virtual environment
   # On Windows:
   flappy_rl_env\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source flappy_rl_env/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install PyTorch (visit https://pytorch.org for specific version)
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
   
   # Install other requirements
   pip install pygame numpy matplotlib
   ```

## 🎮 Usage

### Training the Agent

1. **Basic training** (10,000 episodes):
   ```bash
   python flappy_bird_rl_agent.py
   ```

2. **Custom episode count**:
   ```bash
   python flappy_bird_rl_agent.py 15000
   ```

3. **Training will automatically**:
   - Save the best model when performance improves
   - Save checkpoints every 1000 episodes
   - Display progress every 100 episodes
   - Generate training plots after completion

### Testing the Trained Agent

1. **Test with best model**:
   ```bash
   python flappy_bird_rl_agent.py test
   ```

2. **Test with specific model**:
   ```bash
   python flappy_bird_rl_agent.py test best_flappy_bird_model.pth
   ```

3. **Test with checkpoint model**:
   ```bash
   python flappy_bird_rl_agent.py test flappy_bird_model_episode_5000.pth
   ```

### Manual Game Play (Optional)

Test the game environment manually:
```bash
python flappy_bird_game.py
```
- Use **SPACEBAR** to make the bird jump
- Observe the game mechanics and state representation

## 🧠 Algorithm Details

### Dueling DQN Architecture

The agent uses a **Dueling DQN** which separates:
- **Value function V(s)**: How good is the current state?  
- **Advantage function A(s,a)**: How good is each action relative to others?
- **Q-function**: Q(s,a) = V(s) + A(s,a) - mean(A(s,a'))

### Key Features

1. **Experience Replay Buffer**
   - Stores past experiences (state, action, reward, next_state, done)
   - Breaks temporal correlations in training data
   - Enables multiple learning updates from same experience
   - Buffer size: 10,000 experiences

2. **Target Network**
   - Separate network for computing target Q-values
   - Updated every 1000 training steps
   - Provides stable learning targets
   - Prevents harmful correlations in Q-learning

3. **Epsilon-Greedy Exploration**
   - Balances exploration vs exploitation
   - Starts at ε = 1.0 (full exploration)
   - Decays to ε = 0.01 (minimal exploration)
   - Decay rate: 0.995 per episode

### Hyperparameters

```python
Learning Rate: 0.0005
Gamma (discount): 0.99
Batch Size: 64
Buffer Size: 10,000
Target Update Frequency: 1000 steps
Network Architecture: 256 → 128 → Value(1) + Advantage(2)
```

## 📊 Training Results

Expected training progression:
- **Episodes 0-1000**: Learning basic game mechanics
- **Episodes 1000-3000**: Developing pipe avoidance strategies  
- **Episodes 3000-7000**: Optimizing flight patterns
- **Episodes 7000-10000**: Achieving consistent high scores

Performance metrics to track:
- Average score over 100 episodes
- Maximum score achieved
- Episode duration (target: >240 seconds)
- Training loss convergence

## 🔧 Customization Options

### Modify Hyperparameters

In `flappy_bird_rl_agent.py`, adjust the `DuelingDQNAgent` initialization:

```python
agent = DuelingDQNAgent(
    lr=0.001,           # Learning rate
    gamma=0.95,         # Discount factor  
    epsilon_decay=0.99, # Exploration decay
    buffer_size=20000,  # Experience buffer size
    batch_size=32,      # Training batch size
)
```

### Modify Network Architecture

In the `DuelingDQN` class, change layer sizes:

```python
self.feature_layer = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(state_size, 512),  # Increase hidden size
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(512, 512),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(512, 256),         # Add extra layer
    nn.ReLU()
)
```

### Modify Game Environment

In `flappy_bird_game.py`, adjust difficulty:

```python
self.PIPE_SPEED = 3      # Slower pipes
self.PIPE_GAP = 250      # Larger gap
self.GRAVITY = 0.3       # Less gravity
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CUDA out of memory**
   ```bash
   # Reduce batch size in agent initialization
   batch_size=32  # instead of 64
   ```

2. **Slow training on CPU**
   ```bash
   # The code automatically detects and uses GPU if available
   # Training on CPU will be significantly slower
   ```

3. **Game window not appearing**
   ```bash
   # Install pygame properly:
   pip uninstall pygame
   pip install pygame==2.1.2
   ```

4. **Import errors**
   ```bash
   # Ensure all files are in the same directory
   # Check that virtual environment is activated
   ```

### Performance Tips

- Use GPU for training (10x faster than CPU)
- Start with fewer episodes to test setup (1000 episodes)
- Monitor GPU memory usage during training
- Close game window to speed up training (set render_every=0)

## 📈 Expected Results

After successful training:
- **Average score**: 40-80 points
- **Maximum score**: 100+ points possible
- **Success rate**: >90% of episodes lasting >30 seconds
- **Training time**: 2-4 hours on GPU, 12-24 hours on CPU
